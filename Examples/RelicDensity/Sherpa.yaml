# WARNING: This is an unvalidated, unpublished feature. Do not use it for physics.
# This runcard will compute the LO velocity-weighted cross section <\sigma v> of
# two WIMP dark matter particles annihilating to muons in the galactic halo, and
# generate corresponding events according to the Boltzmann distribution.
# If you are interested in testing and developing this feature further, please contact the authors.
