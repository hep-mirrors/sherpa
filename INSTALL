INSTALLATION:

 - Unpack the Sherpa-1.0.7.tar.gz file obtained from www.sherpa-mc.de
   to the folder where you want Sherpa to reside in (e.g. ~/MySherpa/). 
   When you read this file you will probably have done this already.

 - Open a console.

 - Change to the top-level directory of Sherpa (e.g. ~/MySherpa/). 

 - From there, type 
 
     TOOLS/makeinstall -c
     
   If Sherpa is to be installed into a different directory, the 
   installation prefix can be changed via

     TOOLS/makeinstall --copt --prefix=<your prefix>

   Similarly any configure option may be specified.

 - Wait for the compilation to finish. 

If you encounter a problem with the installation, try
 
  TOOLS/makeinstall -t
    
and / or refer to the SHERPA mini documentation, which is available 
from the Sherpa homepage
