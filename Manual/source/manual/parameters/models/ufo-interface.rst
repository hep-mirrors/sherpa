To use a model generated by the FeynRules package
:cite:`Christensen2008py`,:cite:`Christensen2009jx`, the model must be
made available to Sherpa by running

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ <prefix>/bin/Sherpa-generate-model <path-to-ufo-model>

where ``<path-to-ufo-model>`` specifies the location of the directory
where the UFO model can be found. UFO support must be enabled using
the :option:`-DSHERPA_ENABLE_UFO=ON` option of the configure script, as
described in :ref:`Installation`. This requires Python version 2.6 or
later and an installation of SCons.

The above command generates source code for the UFO model, compiles
it, and installs the corresponding library, making it available for
event generation. Python, SCons, and the UFO model directory are not
required for event generation once the above command has
finished. Note that the installation directory for the created library
and the paths to Sherpa libraries and headers are predetermined
automatically during the installation of Sherpa. If the Sherpa
installation is moved afterwards or if the user does not have the
necessary permissions to install the new library in the predetermined
location, these paths can be set manually.

Please run

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ <prefix>/bin/Sherpa-generate-model --help

for information on the relevant command line arguments.

An example configuration file will be written to the working directory
while the model is generated with ``Sherpa-generate-model``. This
config file shows the syntax for the respective model parameters and
can be used as a template. It is also possible to use an external
parameter file by specifying the path to the file with the switch
:option:`UFO_PARAM_CARD` in the configuration file or on the command
line. Relative and absolute file paths are allowed. This option allows
it to use the native UFO parameter cards, as used by MadGraph for
example.

Note that the use of the SM :option:`PARTICLE_DATA` switches
:option:`Mass`, :option:`Massive`, :option:`Width`, and
:option:`Stable` is discouraged when using UFO models as the UFO model
completely defines all particle properties and their relation to the
independent model parameters. These model parameters should be set
using the standard UFO parameter syntax as shown in the example run
card generated by the ``Sherpa-generate-model`` command.

For parts of the simulation other than the hard process (hadronization,
underlying event, running of the SM couplings) Sherpa uses internal
default values for the Standard Model fermion masses if they are
massless in the UFO model. This is necessary for a meaningful
simulation. In the hard process however, the UFO model masses are always
respected.

For an example UFO setup, see :ref:`MSSM/UFO`. If you want to use an
extremely complex model with many high-multiplicity vertices, the
``Sherpa-generate-model`` step might require a lot of CPU time and memory
even though not all vertices might be necessary for the scattering processes
you plan to study. In such a case it is advised to restrict the number of
external particles in Lorentz and color functions to the default of
``--nmax 4``. Of course you can increase that number if higher-point vertices
are needed.

For more details on the
Sherpa interface to FeynRules please consult
:cite:`Christensen2009jx`,:cite:`Hoeche2014kca`.

Please note that AMEGIC can only be used for the built-in models (SM
and HEFT). The use of UFO models is only supported by Comix.
