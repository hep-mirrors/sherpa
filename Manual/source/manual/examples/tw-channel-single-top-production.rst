================================

.. literalinclude:: /../../Examples/SingleTop_Channels/Sherpa.tW.yaml

Things to notice:

* By setting :option:`No_Decay: -6`, the doubly-resonant TTbar
  diagrams are removed. Only the singly-resonant diagrams remain as
  required by the definition of the channel.

* See :ref:`t-channel single-top production` for more comments
