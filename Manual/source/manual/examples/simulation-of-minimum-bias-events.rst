Simulation of Minimum Bias events
=================================

Contact the :ref:`Authors` for more information.

.. literalinclude:: /../../Examples/Soft_QCD/LHC_7TeV_MinBias/Shrimps.yaml
   :language: yaml

Things to notice:

* The SHRiMPS model is not properly tuned yet -- all parameters are
  set to very natural values, such as for example 1.0 GeV for infrared
  parameters.

* Elastic scattering and low-mass diffraction are not included.

* A large number of Minimum Bias-type analyses is enabled.
